# Hibernate Project

This repository contains materials and resources for working with Hibernate, PLSQL, and related tasks. Below are details and references to guide your work and enhance understanding.

## Lessons and Resources

- **Oracle Slides Lessons (Les)**: While some lessons were printed instead of presented in tables, a simple adjustment could convert them into tabular data as needed.
- **Group 2 Tasks**: Explore PLSQL problems shared on the [Facebook Group](https://web.facebook.com/groups/1129274145098618).

## Key Guidelines

**Creating Triggers**:
   - Avoid using the `SYS` schema to prevent errors. Use a default connection instead.
